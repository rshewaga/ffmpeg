# ffmpeg
A collection of useful ffmpeg bat scripts. These are just convenience wrappers around command line ffmpeg commands.

# Design
See each individual script for its purpose. All scripts have user configurable inputs at the top, including the place to provide your path to your ffmpeg install.

# How to Use
Generally, drag an input file onto the bat script to run it or provide your file as command line arguments to the desired script.
